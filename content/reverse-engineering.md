# Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a software, hardware, or system to understand its architecture, design, and functionality. This can be done to improve the system, fix bugs, or create a compatible system.

## Types of Reverse Engineering

* **Binary Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing compiled binary code to understand its functionality.
* **Source Code Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing source code to understand its architecture and design.

## Tools Used in Reverse Engineering

* **IDA Pro**: A popular disassembler and debugger for reverse engineering binaries.
* **OllyDbg**: A 32-bit debugger for Windows.
* **Ghidra**: A software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the NSA.

## Resources

* **Reverse Engineering Tutorials**: A collection of tutorials on reverse engineering by OpenSecurityTraining.
* **Reverse Engineering Books**: A list of books on reverse engineering available on Amazon.
