# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of secure communication by transforming plaintext into unreadable ciphertext. This can be done to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

## Types of Cryptography

* **Symmetric Cryptography**: Using the same key for encryption and decryption.
* **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Using a pair of keys, one for encryption and another for decryption.

## Cryptographic Algorithms

* **AES**: A popular symmetric encryption algorithm.
* **RSA**: A popular asymmetric encryption algorithm.
* **SHA-256**: A popular hash function for data integrity.

## Tools Used in Cryptography

* **OpenSSL**: A cryptographic library for encrypting and decrypting data.
* **GPG**: A free and open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard.

## Resources

* **Cryptography Tutorials**: A collection of tutorials on cryptography by Crypto101.
* **Cryptography Books**: A list of books on cryptography available on Amazon.
